Imagine that you're preparing for a storm. You've received notification that a storm is coming. You prepare by gathering the tools and materials you'll need to stay safe. You make sure your windows and doors are secure. You assemble a first aid kit, tools, food and water. You're prepared. The storm hits and there are powerful winds and heavy rain. The storm is using its force to try and breach your home. You notice some water leaks and begin patching them quickly in order to minimize any risk or potential damage.

Handling a security incident is no different. Organizations must prepare for the storm by ensuring they have the tools to mitigate and quickly respond to outside threats. The objective is to minimize risk and potential damage.

As a security analyst, you'll work to protect your organization and the people it serves from a variety of risks and outside threats. And if a threat does get through, you and your team will provide a solution to remedy the situation.

To help you better understand what this means, we'll define security and discuss the roles of security professionals in organizations.

Let's start with some definitions: 

> Cybersecurity, or security, is the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.

For example, requiring complex passwords to access sites and services improves confidentiality by making it much more difficult for a threat actor to compromise them. 

> A threat actor is any person or group who presents a security risk.

Now that you know the definition of security, let's discuss what security teams do for an organization.

> Benefits of security
> - Protects against external abd internal threats

Security protects against external and internal threats. An external threat is someone outside of the organization trying to gain access to private information, networks or devices.

An internal threat comes from current or former employees, external vendors, or trusted partners. Often these internal threats are accidental, such as an employee clicking on a compromised link in an email. Other times, the internal actor intentionally engages in activities such as unauthorized data access or abusing systems for personal use.

Experienced security professionals will help organizations mitigate or reduce the impact of threats like these.

> Benefits of security
> - Protects against external abd internal threats
> - Meets regulatory compliance

Security teams also ensure an organization meets regulatory compliance, or laws and guidelines, that require the implementation of specific security standards.

Ensuring that organizations are in compliance may allow them to avoid fines and audits, while also upholding their ethical obligation to protect users.

> Benefits of security
> - Protects against external abd internal threats
> - Meets regulatory compliance
> - Maintains and improves business productivity

Security teams also maintain and improve business productivity. By establishing a plan for business continuity, security teams allow people to do their jobs, even in the case of something like a data breach.

> Benefits of security
> - Protects against external abd internal threats
> - Meets regulatory compliance
> - Maintains and improves business productivity
> - Reduces expenses

Being security conscious can also reduce expenses associated with risks, such as recovering from data loss or operational downtime, and potentially avoiding fines. 

> - Protects against external abd internal threats
> - Meets regulatory compliance
> - Maintains and improves business productivity
> - Reduces expenses
> - Maintains brand trust

The last benefit of security that we'll discuss is maintaining brand trust. If services or customer data are compromised, this can lower trust in the organization, damage the brand, and hurt the business in the long term. Loss of customer trust may also lead to less revenue for the business.

Now, let's go over some common security-based roles. After completing this certificate program, here are some job titles you may want to search for: 

> Common job titles
> - Security analyst or specialist
> - Cybersecurity analyst or specialist
> - Security operation center (SCO) analyst
> - Information security analyst

Security analyst or specialist, Cybersecurity analyst or specialist, Security operation center or SOC analyst, Information security analyst.

You'll also learn more about the responsibilities associated with some of these job titles later in the program.

As you may now realize, the field of security includes many topics and concepts and every activity you complete in this program moves you one step closer to a new job. Let's keep learning together.

Hi, I'm Toni, I'm a Security Engineering Manager. Our teams protect Google and its users from serious threats. Usually government-backed attackers, coordinated influence operations and serious cybercrime threat actors. I grew up as an army brat. My dad was in the military and we moved around a lot. I've always had an interest in security sort of generally. I got really hooked on international relations when I was in high school. I did a lot of Model United Nations. And that really sort of brought these two things together for me, the way that security works in the world. I come from a big family. I knew I was going to need financial assistance to go to college. And the Department of Defense provides a lot of educational opportunities that are tied to service. So this was a natural fit for me. I knew I was interested in this area and this was going to provide a career path into something I was passionate about. 

I started as an intelligence analyst, but not focused on cybersecurity. I worked counterinsurgency for a number of years and geopolitical intelligence issues. Eventually, as I looked and saw that the way that cybersecurity was starting to have an impact both in our daily lives and in that world of international relations, I got more and more drawn to it. Transitioning into cybersecurity was a huge shift for me. I came in without a solid technical background, had to learn a lot of that on the job and through self-paced learning in different types of courses, I needed to learn programming languages like Python and SQL, two of the things that we cover in this certificate, I needed to learn a whole new language about the vocabulary of threats and the different components and how those manifest technically. 

One of the things that I had to figure out very early in this journey is what kind of learner I was. I work best with a structured learning style. So turning to a lot of these online courses and resources that took this material and structured it sort of from first principles through application resonated very well for me. A lot of this was also learned on the job by co-workers who were willing to share and invest time in helping me understand this. I asked a lot of questions and I still do. Most of cybersecurity work is going to be learned on the job in the specific environment that you're protecting. 

So you have to work well with your teammates in order to be able to build that knowledge base. My advice would be to stay curious and keep learning, especially focusing on your technical skills and growing those throughout your career. It's really easy to get imposter syndrome in cybersecurity because it's so broad and mastery of all these different areas is a lifetime's work. And sometimes that imposter syndrome can shut us down and make it feel like, why bother trying to keep growing. I'm never going to be able to master this instead of motivating us. So keep learning, push through that fear. The efforts always going to be rewarded.
