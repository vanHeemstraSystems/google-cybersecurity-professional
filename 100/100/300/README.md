## What to expect
Each course offers many types of learning opportunities:

- **Videos** led by Google instructors teach new concepts, introduce the use of relevant tools, offer career support, and provide inspirational personal stories. 

- **Readings** build on the topics discussed in the videos, introduce related concepts, share useful resources, and describe case studies.

- **Connect with other learners**: If you have a question, chances are, you’re not alone. Visit Coursera’s private [Cybersecurity Community](http://www.coursera.support/s/group-invite?id=MEY5VkgwMDAwMDAwMWMxMEFB) to expand your network, discuss career journeys, and share experiences. Check out the 
[quick start guide](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/Community-Quick-Start-Guide).

- **Self-review activities** and **labs** give you hands-on practice in applying the skills you are learning and allow you to assess your own work by comparing it to a completed example.

- **Interactive plug-ins** encourage you to practice specific tasks and help you integrate knowledge you have gained in the course.

- **In-video quizzes** help you check your comprehension as you progress through each video.

- **Practice quizzes** allow you to check your understanding of key concepts and provide valuable feedback.

- **Graded quizzes** demonstrate your understanding of the main concepts of a course. You must score 80% or higher on each graded quiz to obtain a certificate, and you can take a graded quiz multiple times to achieve a passing score.
