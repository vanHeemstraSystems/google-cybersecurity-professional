# 900 - Participate in Program Surveys

During this certificate program, you will be asked to complete a few short surveys. These are part of a research study being conducted to understand how effectively the certificate meets your career training needs. Keep reading for a summary of what each survey will cover.

Your survey participation is optional but extremely helpful in making this program as effective as possible. All data is kept confidential and is aggregated for review in accordance with [Coursera’s privacy policy](https://www.coursera.org/about/privacy). Your name is separated from your data when it is stored.

There are no right or wrong answers. Your responses or personal data:

- Won’t affect your program experience, scores, or ability to receive a certificate or job offer

- Won’t be shared outside of our research team unless you give permission to share your contact information with hiring partners

Thanks for your consideration and time!  

## Entry survey
First, you will have an opportunity to answer a brief survey to help researchers understand why you enrolled in this certificate program. If you don’t fill out the survey now, you will receive an invitation to fill it out after completing your first video or activity.

The survey asks about your experiences leading up to this program and the goals you hope to achieve. This is critical information to ensure your needs as a learner are met and that this program will continue to be offered in the future. 

## Individual course feedback
After you complete the last graded assignment within an individual course, you might be asked to complete a survey. This survey will revisit questions from the previous survey and ask what you have learned up to that point in the program. Again, filling out this information is voluntary but extremely beneficial to the program and future learners.

## Certificate completion survey
After you complete the last graded assignment in the final (eighth) course of the certificate program, you will be asked to complete a survey that revisits some earlier questions and asks what you have learned throughout the duration of the program. This survey also asks whether you would like to share your contact information with prospective employers. Filling out the survey and sharing your contact information with prospective employers is completely optional and will not affect your course experience, scores, or ability to receive a certificate or job offer in any way.
